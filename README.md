BLOS V1 - Guitar Amp Simulator
This plugin simulates the basic structure of a guitar amp.
The input section, volume & gain, set the input levels for the audio in use.
The presence & master dials control the output levels.
The master dial controlls the overall volume.
The presence dial blends the input section with the audio passing through, turning this dial up acts in similar fashion to a boost or overdrive.
The equalisation section offers the user full scope over their tone.
Bass controls frequencies up to 250Hz
Mid boosts between 250-700Hz
Treb controls frequencies over 750Hz
Both bass & treb have a cut/boost dial to further hone the users tone.
